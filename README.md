Arduino 101 PIR Sensor

Components used in this project: 1x Arduino 101 3x Jumper wire 1x PIR sensor 1x LED light 1x USB cable

Background: Arduino 101 is a microcontroller which can take in inputs and produce an output. In essence, it is a small piece of hardware which has basic computing functionalities and is simple to configure with software.

PIR Sensor: The PIR sensor is an infrared based device which detects heat emitted from an entity. Due to it being passive, it does not take any energy to detect heat. The sensors are made of pyroelectric materials which generate voltage when capturing heat.

LED Light: An LED emits light whenever current passes through it. For this project, whenever the PIR sensor detects warmth it will send current to the LED and it will turn on briefly before turning off.
